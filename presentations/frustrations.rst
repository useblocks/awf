.. revealjs:: Potential of Frustration

    | **For each document type you may need a different tool**
    | Frustration: Context/tool switches during development
    |
    | **Most tools forces you to somehow "style" your information**
    | Frustration: Spend time for not functional nor informative work
    |
    | **No synchronisation with existing code**
    | Frustration: Maintain same code / information at different locations
    |
    | **No storage, versioning or deployment together with your code**
    | Frustration: No reuse of existing development tool chain
