Documentation Without Frustration (DWF)
=======================================
DWF is a collection of documentations, presentations and examples to introduce an
easy way of writing and maintaining documentation inside small to mid-size software projects.

Key audience for this kind of information are software engineers, who need to create, present and maintain
documentations from the first requirement to final deployment report.

Presentation
------------
Our complete DWF presentation can be found on: https://useblocks.com/dwf

Limitations
-----------
The presented approach is very code centric and handles the documentation topic only.

There are a lot of specialised tools, e.g. for architecture design, which are more suitable for the design process
itself. But they may fail if it comes to the point of integration with other documents or supporting
version control systems.
